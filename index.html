                I am a flood of inspiration and creativity looking to break past
                the barriers placed by my soon-to-be profession and utilize my
                newly acquired coding skills to enter the world of web
                development. Born in the quiet and cozy neighborhood of Fairwood
                in Renton, WA, I lived a relatively charmed life flying through
                the education system with good grades and even better friends.
                There were some hiccups along the way (as is with anyone), but
                after four years of undergraduate work (B.S. in Biology from
                WSU), one year of service in AmeriCorps (worked in the Federal
                Way School District as a tutor), and two years of a masters
                degree (MAT from SPU) I was finally in the profession of my
                dreams (teaching high school biology at Foster High School in
                Tukwila, WA). Little did I know the toll that job would place on
                me.

                Working as a teacher definitely has its ups and downs. The best
                part about teaching is not the delivery of content, but the
                relationships I built with my students based on mutual respect,
                and a drive to push them to be their very best. The worst part
                was the soul crushing pressure to deliver content that met the
                needs of students with different learning levels (from those
                receiving services for special education to honors level
                students) and different language needs (from little to no
                English to fluent) with either no support or unnecessary hurdles
                provided by the district administration. I tried a change of
                districts in hopes for better working conditions only to find
                different but equally devastating practices. It was only after
                eight years of this struggle that I realized a change in
                profession was the only way to protect my physical and mental
                health.

                Here is where I see web development saving my life. In this
                profession I truly see a pathway to break free from my
                oppressive world into a new one filled with possibility. I want
                to become a web developer because I feel it will allow me to
                unleash my creative instincts where my only limits are what I
                can imagine. I know this journey will have challenges as well,
                but I welcome them with open arms and a grinning face. Already
                in this journey I have found great joy in the challenge of
                making my code work and am excited at the chance to do this as a
                profession. As you peruse my portfolio I hope you see the time,
                passion, and painstaking effort spent towards each line of code.
